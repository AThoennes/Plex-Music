# Plex-Music

This is a python script I wrote to download all the music from my plex server.
It uses the plexapi for python which can be found [here.](http://python-plexapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
For now, this script only lets you enter the atist you would like to download.
You can enter as many artists as you would like to download, and when you are done
you type *x* to start the download. If you would like to download every single song
for every single artist in the music library, you enter *\**. This symbolizes everything.
After that you follow it with and *x* and you will start downloading the music. All the music
is downloaded to a directory on your destop called *plex music*.

## Installation

The installation is very simple. All you need to do is install plexapi and you're good to go.
You can do this by going into terminal and entering **pip install plexapi**. Examples of how
to use the api as well as the documentation can be found [here.](http://python-plexapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
